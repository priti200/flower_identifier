# BlossomSpot


### About:
BlossomSpot is a web app which will help you to identify the name and info of the flower you will upload. You can choose an image file of any flower and click on the identify button to know the name and informations like scientific name, family, genus etc. 

### Stack Used:

* HTML
* CSS
* JAVASCRIPT


### Aproach:

I used the plant.id API to create this web app. I generated an Api Key from the official page of plant.id. After generating the key. I used that in script.js file to fetch the data after getting image file as input. This Api is specially used for fetching the informations of the plants. I had to do some research before doing this , tried some other API as well but those did not work out. 


### Problems faced:

* The Api key sometime may not work as in my case it did not work and I had to create another API KEY to create this. If you face any error related to json then you must generate a new api key.
